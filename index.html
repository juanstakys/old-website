            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm a programmer from Argentina, very passionate about MATHS and LANGUAGE LEARNING. I was always
                interested in technology and at 15 I started programming. I had participated in Maths Olympiads at
                around the same age, until I finished secondary education. Immediately after I started working as a
                Software Developer at a consultant in my country.</p>
            <p>I have explored MANY LANGUAGES: German, Japanese, Russian, Chinese, Arabic, and currently I'm focused on
                learning French. I have also developed a strong interest in linguistics and philosophy, specially
                logical thinking.</p>
            <p>Nowadays I'm studying Systems engineering at Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional.</p>
            <p>I love making projects and I'm eager to participate in new, exciting ones.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Racist-o-meter</h3>
                    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/juanstakys/racist-o-meter-reactjs">ReactJS webapp</a>
                        and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/juanstakys/racist-o-meter">Flutter mobile
                            app</a> with voice recognition, that detects whether the pronounced statement is racist or
                        not, and gives a brief explanation. It uses <a target="_blank"
                            href="https://github.com/juanstakys/racist_o_meter_backend">NodeJS in the backend</a> and ChatGPT. In the future I intend to implement a database that saves previous responses to minimize costs in case of similar requests. This
                        project is based on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/XosEdKikOAc">this
                            video</a>. Link to the repos above.</p>

                    <h3>Ajedrez a voz (Chess by voice)</h3>
                    <p>Web-based chessboard commanded by voice. Ideal for people with special accesibility needs. Great
                        for people practicing chess coordinates and blindfold chess. <a

                    <h3>Conteo de palabras conocidas</h3>
                    <p>My first original project: A Python program that shows random words from the Spanish dictionary,
                        one at the time, and by selecting which ones you know and which ones you don't it estimates how
                        many words from the language you know. <a
