            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm a programmer from Argentina, very passionate about MATHS and LANGUAGE LEARNING. I was always
                interested in technology and at 15 I started programming. I had participated in Maths Olympiads at
                around the same age, until I finished secondary education. Immediately after I started working as a
                Software Developer at a consultant in my country.</p>
            <p>I have explored MANY LANGUAGES: German, Japanese, Russian, Chinese, Arabic, and currently I'm focused on
                learning French. I have also developed a strong interest in linguistics and philosophy, specially
                logical thinking.</p>
            <p>Nowadays I'm studying Systems engineering at Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional.</p>
            <p>I love making projects and I'm eager to participate in new, exciting ones.</p>
